Written in Python version 3.8.5
Usage similiar to Linux rsync. 
python(3) rsync.py [OPTION]... [SRC] ... [DEST]

Options:
-d, --dirs                  transfer directories without recursing
-n, --dry-run               perform a trial run with no changes made and prints transfer list
-h, --help                  show this help (-h is --help only if used alone)
-v, --verbose               increase verbosity

examples:
Print help text: >>> python(3) rsync.py -h/--help 
Transfer single file >>> python(3) rsync.py path_to_source path_to_dest
Transfer with wildcard >>> python(3) rsync.py path_to_source/* path_to_dest
Transfer with extension >>> python(3) rsync.py path_to_source/*.ext path_to_dest
Transfer directory >>> python(3) rsync.py -d path_to_source/*.ext path_to_dest


Issues and improvements:
- I did integration tests instead of unit tests in the interest of time and because the functions are quite small
- I used inittest for this, also in the interest of time
- Happy to hear any other feedback!
